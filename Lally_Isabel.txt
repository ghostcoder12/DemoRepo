Hello,
I am Isabel Lally.  I was born and raised in Long Beach, CA and moved to Ladson, SC a few years ago.  I foster kittens when I have free time and have 5 cats of my own.  I am currently the president of the Women in Computing club (first meeting will be next thursday).  I'm looking to move back to California after I graduate in May.
