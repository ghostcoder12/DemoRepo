Hello everyone, my name is Cormac Conahan. 
I am a senior computer science major here at the College of Charleston. 
I was born in Texas but I moved to South Carolina almost before I can remember. 
I love rock climbing, surfing, hiking, and basically all things outdoors. 
I am looking forward to working with you all!
