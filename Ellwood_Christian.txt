Hi! I am Christian Ellwood, and I am a senior in Computer Science. I am also a Russian Studies and math minor and 
spend a lot of my free time relaxing with my cat. This is my last semester and I already have plans to move to 
Columbia this summer and start work there with a company! Currently, I am a math tutor outside of school for work.
My favorite genre of movie is horror comedy and I look forward to getting this last semester in the books!
