Hello

My name is Ian Dudderar and I am a senior computer science major. I took CSCI 362 with Dr. Bowring
last semester and found it very challenging, but I am excited to continue in this class, as I feel
more comfortable with the material this time. Hopefully I continute to learn and improve my skills.
