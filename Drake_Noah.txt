My name is Noah Drake, I'm a senior at the College of Charleston, and I 
major in history and computer science. For most of my life, I have 
lived in Georgia; I moved to South Carolina in 2017. After school, I 
want to work in software development of some kind, but I'm not really 
sure exactly what kind yet.
